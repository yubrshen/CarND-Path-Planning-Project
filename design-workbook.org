#+TITLE: Design of Path Planning for Self Driving Car

* Introduction

This document provides a design and implementation of path planning for self-driving-car. It's a project
for Udacity Nano-Degree of Self-Driving-Car.

The document uses [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] approach to present the
design and implementation. It presents software construction as prose of writing natural language narrative.
The key distinction is that all text are comments to code, while code are presented in special code block.
For details of it, please check the link for it.
With this style of narrative, key chunks of code relevant to higher level design are presented with
much more thought process presented. This would make the source code much more understandable, removing the challenges of providing
updated and appropriate comments to the source code.

The full source code can be generated from this literate programming document: ./design-workbook.org

In this design document, "my_car" refers to the car being controlled by the path planner.


* The definition of data

  The following is the definition of the input and output data. They serves as the assumption of the
  design.

  They are copied from the project requirements with some my own digestion.

** Definition of waypoint data
- Waypoint Data
Each waypoint has an (x,y) global map position, and a Frenet s value and Frenet d unit normal vector (split up into the x component, and the y component).

The s value is the distance along the direction of the road.
The first waypoint has an s value of 0 because it is the starting point.

The d vector has a magnitude of 1 and
points perpendicular to the road in the direction of the right-hand side of the road.
The d vector can be used to calculate lane positions.
For example, if you want to be in the left lane at some waypoint
just add the waypoint's (x,y) coordinates with the d vector multiplied by 2.
Since the lane is 4 m wide,
the middle of the left lane (the lane closest to the double-yellow diving line) is 2 m
from the waypoint.

If you would like to be in the middle lane,
add the waypoint's coordinates to the d vector multiplied by 6 = (2+4),
since the center of the middle lane is 4 m from the center of the left lane,
which is itself 2 m from the double-yellow diving line and the waypoints.

** Definition of sensor_fusion data
The data format for each car is:
[ id, x, y, v_x, v_y, s, d].
The id is a unique identifier for that car.
The x, y values are in global map coordinates, and
the v_x, v_y values are the velocity components, also in reference to the global map.
Finally s and d are the Frenet coordinates for that car.

The v_x, v_y values can be useful for predicting where the cars will be in the future.
For instance, if you were to assume that the tracked car kept moving along the road,
then its future predicted Frenet s value will be its current s value
plus its (transformed) total velocity (m/s) multiplied by the time elapsed into the future (s).

* The interface to the simulator

  The path planning module should send to the simulator,
  the x, y coordinates in an interval to drive the car to move to the given coordinates.

  The interval that the simulator moves the car along is fixed. The value is 0.02 seconds.

  The spacing between the points with the fixed interval determines the speed and acceleration of the
  car.

  The code responsible for interacting and driving the simulator as follows:

  #+NAME:driving-simulator
  #+BEGIN_SRC C++ :noweb tangle :tangle
    if (event == "telemetry")
      {
        // j[1] is the data JSON object
        // My car's localization Data
        double car_x = j[1]["x"];
        double car_y = j[1]["y"];
        double car_s = j[1]["s"];
        double car_d = j[1]["d"];
        double car_yaw = j[1]["yaw"]; // in degree
        double car_speed = j[1]["speed"]; // in mile per hour

        // Previous path data given to the Planner
        // actually they are the remaining points of trajectory not yet visited by the car
        // they are issued by the path planner to the car in the previous control time
        auto remaining_path_x = j[1]["previous_path_x"];
        auto remaining_path_y = j[1]["previous_path_y"];
        // Previous path's end s and d values
        double remaining_path_end_s = j[1]["end_path_s"];
        // not yet used, keep for documentation purpose
        double remaining_path_end_d = j[1]["end_path_d"];
        // not yet used, keep might be needed

        // Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other cars on the same side of the road.
        auto sensor_fusion = j[1]["sensor_fusion"];

        <<path_plan>>

        json msgJson;
        msgJson["next_x"] = trajectory.x_vals;
        msgJson["next_y"] = trajectory.y_vals;

        auto msg = "42[\"control\","+ msgJson.dump()+"]";

        //this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(1000));
        ws.send(msg.data(), msg.length(), uWS::OpCode::TEXT);
      }
  #+END_SRC

  In the above code listing, ="<<path_plan>>"= is the notation to indicate that a code block named "path_plan" will be inserted at the place in
  the eventual source code generation.

  The code block is the implementation of path planning integrated into the telemetry processing loop.


* Top level design
** Majors Modules

  The path planner are consists of the following modules:

- Kinematics: collect and analysis of my_car's kinematics information required for maneuver decision in relationship to the other cares
- Maneuvers: determines the appropriate maneuver
- Trajectory: create the smooth trajectory
- Data-model: the common data structures to support the other modules


  I presents the design from top to bottom for ease of review.

** Path Planner Data Model

Here are the main data structures for the construction of the path planner. It's the main body of concepts and vocabulary of the degsin.

From the sensor fusion data, we need to find the nearest vehicles in each lane in front of my_car and behind,
and also the projected nearest distance to the nearest vehicle. The nearest distance is further processed into congestion characterization.

The congestion with the nearest vehicle would be used to compute the cost of collision and buffer.

The distance would be calculated based on the time horizon when the new trajectory would start to be used, till the end of the new
trajectory.

** path_plan
path_plan code is the top most level program for path planning.
   It ingests update of my_car's status while performing necessary transformation.
   Especially, it bases on the current location of my_car, improves the accuracy of the waypoint maps in order to achieve higher accuracy in
   estimation of locations.

   Then it calls =trajectory_f= to generate the new trajectory in trajectory data structure, which will be fed to the simulator for subsequent
   control.

** trajactory

   Produces the next trajectory to control the car based on my_car's sates, sensor fusion data of the other cars in the roads.

   For trajectory generations,
- it first parses the sensor data producing the lane congestion status in relationship to the position
and current speed of =my_car=. This is implemented by =parse_sensor_data=. The congestion information is returned in =data_lanes=

- based on the congestion information, it considers maneuver options including keep the current lane, or change to adjacent lanes. It selects the
  option with the least cost. This is implemented by =maneuver=. The decision is returned in =decision=.

- the rest of the code, generate the trajectory for the selected decision.

The decision is defined in terms of the lane to change to, the speed to use, etc.

The new trajectory is formed by combing the first portion of the remaining trajectory that had been fed to the simulator, and additional trajectory
points. Special caution is made to make smooth transition from the previously planned trajectory and the additional points.

The smoothness is realized using spline routine with two points from the end of adopted previous trajectory
and two points dictated by the maneuver decision.

With the 4 seeding points, two spline lines are generated
in terms of functions from frenet s coordinate value to the corresponding x, and y coordinate values respectively.

The purpose of the above scheme is to generate speed control spaced trajectory points. Another series of s coordinate values corresponding to the number
of additional trajectory points is generated such that the length between consecutive s $\delta s$ value would satisfy with the following:


\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:1}
\delta s & = & v \cdot \delta t
\end{eqnarray}

where $v$ is the expected velocity for my_car for the segment on frenet coordinate, and $\delta t$ is the time interval which simulator updates the car's
position.

The expected velocity for segment is calculated based the starting velocity from at the start of the adopted remaining trajectory,
in the series of segment, each segment would increment a delta. The value of the delta is empirically determined to avoid increasing too abruptly, not as to generate the feeling of jerk to the
passengers in the car. The increment would become zero when the speed reaches the target speed. The target speed is the speed at the end of the new trajectory.

This algorithm may not be accurate. Sometimes, it may still lead to jerk, and often it may be drive the car too slow.

The following approximation might work better:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:2}
\delta v & = & \frac{(v_{end} -v_{start})}{n}
\end{eqnarray}

where $\delta v$ is the increment in velocity,
$v_{start}$ the starting speed of my_car at the start of the adopted remaining trajectory.
$v_{end}$ the expected speed of my_car at the end of the new trajectory.

$v_{start}$ value can be rather reliably estimated based on
the remaining trajectory data with waypoints.

It's $v_{end}$ that I may not have confidence. The current approximation may be too large often. I may revisit the related kinematics modeling.

We use the generated s sequence access the two spline functions to get the corresponding x, and y values respectively,
then the x, y value pair would be the expected additional trajectory.

Finally, we join the adopted portion of the remaining trajectory and the newly generated trajectory.

** congestion characterization

   This models the congestion condition between two cars, the front and the behind, on the same lane, supposing if my_car would be in that lane.

   The function returns the congestion coefficient between the two cars.

   Here is more motivation discussion:

Simpply considering the shortest distance between two car is not enough. The time to reach the low limit of distance also matter. The sooner to reach, the worst.
So in terms of cost, I can expression the cost inversely proportional to the time reaching the low limit, and the distance at the time.

For the case, when the front car is faster, then the time is at the start of the trajectory, and the distance is at the time of the trajectory start.

For the case, when the front car is slower, the distance is going to reduce over time further. So I can only measure when the time
the distance becomes not acceptable.

** maneuver

   This is the top level program to consider applicable options and select the one with the lowest cost.
It outputs in terms of a structure =Decision=.

The structure Decision represent all the consequence of a maneuver decision including
- the targeted velocity,  acceleration,
- the target lane changed into, etc.

It only considers that the lanes that are consider to be safe at the time of the beginning of the new planned trajectory.

For each plausible maneuver options, =evaluate_decision= performs the analysis and outputs the details of the decision, and also provides the cost of the decision.

Then the decision with the lowest cost will be selected as the decision.

** kinematic_required_in_front

    Calculate at the start of new trajectory, the required and permitted (maximum) velocity and acceleration and speed.

    All the expected kinematic data of interests are stored in the structure KINEMATIC. It's the type of the return value.

    The target velocity will be computed. It's needed as the target speed to adjust my_car's speed in the new trajectory
    generation in =trajectory_f=, when my_car change lane.

    It's not reasonable to expect the car to accelerate/deacceleration within one update interval. This might be the root cause of
    the car jerks too often. It's reasonable to assume that a car would be able to adjust the speed in a few seconds.
    I'd experiment with 5 seconds. I call this the planning horizon. I should use consistently wherever applicable.
    This is the time period that a reasonable car should be adjust its speed to the range desirable.

    This is an experimental design. I have not found better approximation yet given the time limit.

Considering all possible costs:
- collision
- buffer_cost
- inefficiency_cost
- not_middle_cost: encourage to be in the middle lane

Add all of them together.

- projected speed of my_car with the maneuver, based on the projected acceleration/speed
- distance to the car in front, or behind (closest_approach), based on data_lanes data structure
- the time to collision, based on the projected acceleration and data_lanes (not yet fully considered successfully)

* Performance

  The path planner can drive the car to run multiple full lapses of the track. Most of the time the car runs steady.
But sometimes, it has problem of exceeding the speed limits, and may have some exceeding the jerk limit.
Occasionally, it might even have collision.

* Further investigation

1. Need to explore how to have better algorithm of the speed control to avoid the problems of exceeding jerk limit.
   Maybe, the criterion whether to adopt the velocity of the car in front can be typed to certain threshold of
   the congestion in the lane between my_car and the one in front. For example, the congestion value when the front car is
   slower and the distance at the start_time of the new trajectory to be equal to SAFE_DISTANCE.

2. The adjustment increment of velocity VELOCITY_INCREMENT is very sensitive to the stability of the my_car driving. More
   study is needed.

** Other design decisions

   - Use meter per seconds to measure speed
     As the measure of distance and speed from fusion data is in meters, and the update interval
     is in seconds (0.02 seconds).
     The exception is the measurement of the speed of "my_car" (the car being controlled),
   it's speed is in mph (mile per hour).
** Control Parameters

   There are mainly two control choices at the each interval (UPDATE_INTERVAL seconds):
   - lane
   - velocity/acceleration/deceleration

   Changing lane would be desirable if the controlled car have to severely slowdow or even being crashed in the current line.
   The acceleration/deceleration should be adjusted to be safe, fast and comfortable.

   It seems that changing lane is more fundamental maneuver, I'll focus on it while assuming a constant acceleration/deceleration
   for now. Given the short interval of UPDATE_INTERVAL second control interval, it may be OK to assume small constant acceleration/deceleration.
   The assumption has been partially confirmed in experiment.
   The acceleration/deceleration is assumed to be (+2.24m/s^2 or -2.24/s^2).

** Selection of Lane

   Assuming the acceleration/deceleration controlled to maximize the speed within legal limit,
   the major consideration of selection of a lane,
   is to avoid collision without too much slowing down.
   Given other considerations being equal, changing lane may involve additional collision
   risk, and overhead.

   Therefore, the control problem would be modeled by cost function, and
   the control solution should have the lowest cost among all the legal lane choices.
   The cost function would have the following components:
   - collision cost
   - changing lane cost
*** Collision Cost
    The collision cost reflects the risks of collision.
    The risk of collision has 4 scenarios:
    - Longitudinal collision:
      - collision with the car in front
      - collision by the car in the back
    - Lateral collision:
      - collision by the car in the left
      - collision by the car in the right

    The longitudinal collision can be characterized the overlapping of vehicles' body from the moment of evaluation to the foreseeable future.

*** Changing lane cost

    Changing lane cost may have one major components and one minor component.
    The major components is the lateral collision risk. It will be proportional to the collision cost then.

    The minor component is the overhead and discomfort caused. This is hard to estimate. It will be assumed as a constant for now.

** Avoiding lateral collision and interference

   It's not desirable to be next to another car in the adjacent lane.
   This problem can only solved by adjusting the acceleration/deceleration.
   Thus, this is a case that should be considered with adjustment of acceleration/deceleration.

   It will be less likely, and will be a refinement to do in the future.

   Currently, it only tries to avoid changing lane when there is a car next to in the adjacent lane.
